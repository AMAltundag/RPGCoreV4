Should you create a fork of rpgcore you must make sources, binaries and configurations
available to the public at no cost. I explicitly forbid anyone from monetizing this project
in any shape or form.

Should you be using a modified version of rpgcore on your own server these rules do not
apply to you, unless you are providing anyone outside of the server with rpgcore.

Configurations are intentionally not provided, this is not an oversight. Only people
who had purchased RPGCore (and thus would have the configurations) are meant to have 
a functioning installation.

You are welcome to use the sources as a reference.
